The only argument passed on the command line will be the path to an input file

Open that input file and read student info from the file

There will be four space-separated strings (one student) per line

Read (index, mode) pairs from stdin to access a particular Student in your array and print according to the mode

One new mode: YEARS_LEFT_AND_NAME
